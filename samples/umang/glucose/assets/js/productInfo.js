          'desc': "MAHAM-ADBLU is a diesel exhaust fluid (DEF) that reduces air pollution created by diesel engines. It is a clear, non-toxic, non-polluting and non-hazardous solution of pure automotive grade urea in demineralised water. Urea content in the solution is closely controlled in the range of 31.8% to 33.2%. Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system is used to reduce the amount of harmful NO released into the atmosphere. It is injected into the exhaust pipeline. Within the SCR catalyst, the NO, is reduced to harmless nitrogen and water. It is a specially designed DEF for SCR systems used in diesel powered vehicles (on-road and off-road) conforming to BS IV and BS VI emission norms. It is used to control NO emission.",
